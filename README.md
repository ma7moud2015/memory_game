# memory_game
A Memory Game project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only with no external libraries. This project is done as practical deployment to learnt mentioned languages, so be prepared to unintended faults, incompatible code, or redundant blocks of code. So, I'd be very happy to hear your comments, changes, and pull requests to the repo.
